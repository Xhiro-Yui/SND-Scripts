# CosmoCraft
## To Do List
- Automatically grab player's current class. SND function currently broken or I'm dumb
- Implement a prioritizer to allow players to choose if they want to do Time missions over Weather or vice versa 
- Implement auto navigate to Critical Mission areas and do those missions (including submitting the items)

## Integrations
### [Artisan](https://github.com/PunishXIV/Artisan)
- Uses Artisan Endurance mode to craft items. This means if you have set Artisan to use consumables during a craft, it will automatically do it for you.
- Currently script will fail (and potentially crash) if consumables run out. Please stock large amounts in advance.

## Version History 
I am lazy to write this most of the time, expect skips or permanent version numbers despite updates.

#### v1.2
- Artisan mode should no longer crash. Critical mission mode WILL CRASH. To be fixed later

#### v1.1
- Uses Artisan's Endurance mode if the option is selected (check Settings)

#### v1.0
- Initial version
