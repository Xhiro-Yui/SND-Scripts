# CosmoCraft
## To Do List
- Hook with Artisan maybe? Not sure how to get Recipe IDs
- If can't hook with Artisan, self eat food/pots
- Automatically grab player's current class. SND function currently broken or I'm dumb
- Implement a prioritizer to allow players to choose if they want to do Time missions over Weather or vice versa 
- Implement auto navigate to Critical Mission areas and do those missions (including submitting the items)
